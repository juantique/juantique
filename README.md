Hi my name is Juan Conde Tique, i am a Systems Enginner from the Antonio Nariño University, 
in Bogotá Colombia. The goal of these projects is to help orient them in the world of programming. 
Although there is a lot of documentation and video tutorials, there are topics that are not covered
in depth.
For this reason, create this space so that they can be oriented in a practical way. I will be constantly
updating the projects that i have uploaded to the repository. And those who have not yet fully uploaded
is because they finished their improvement stage.

Thank you very musch, any collaboration and suggestion i will gladly be pending.
